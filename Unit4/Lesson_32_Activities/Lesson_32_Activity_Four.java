/*
* Lesson 32 Coding Activity 4
* 
* For the Lesson 32 activities, you will be asked to write one or more methods.
* Use the template to write a main method that tests each of your methods, 
* then paste everything into the code runner box. Your submission should 
* begin with the first import statement and end with the final }.
* 
* Write a method that accepts a number of seconds and prints the
* correct number of hours, minutes and seconds.
* 
* This method must be called realTime() and its parameter must be an integer. 
* 
* Calling realTime(6342) would print the following:
* 
*      Hours: 1
*      Minutes: 45
*      Seconds: 42

    seconds %= 3600;
    
    int minutes = seconds / 60;
    seconds %= 60;
