/*
 * Lesson 29 Coding Activity 1
 * A student wants an algorithm to find the hardest spelling
 * word in a list of vocabulary. They define hardest by the longest word.
 * Write the code to find the longest word stored in an array of Strings called list.
 * If several words have the same length it should print the first word 
 * in list with the longest length.
 * For example, if the following list were declared:
 * 
 *     String list [] = {"high", "every", "nearing", "checking", "food ", 
 *     "stand", "value",  "best", "energy", "add", "grand", "notation",
 *     "abducted", "food ", "stand"};
 * 
 * It would print:
 *     checking
